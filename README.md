# Weather App

Welcome to my 5 day weather forecasting app. The motivation behind this was to get comfortable using:

- React
- JSX
- API calls

## User Stories

As anÂ **MVP**:

- Users should be able to see the name and country of the city the forecast is for.
- Users should be able to see a summary of each day of the forecast, including the date, general description of the weather that day, and maximum temperature.
- Users should be able to click on one of the summaries to view all of the forecasted information for that date.

The goal was to make the app look like this:
